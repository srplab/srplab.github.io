<p>Portability is an issue we must consider when developing applications. The most portable language is ansi c. However, due to the lack of functional libraries, applications are not easy to write and need to take a long time to market. An alternative is to use a scripting language, such as python, ruby, or lua. With the help of CLE middleware, these scripting languages can run on most platforms such as windows, windows 10, ios, android, linux.</p>

<p>CLE is a middleware to support mixed programming of multiple languages. Any language of c/c++, lua, python, c#, java can access most classes, functions, variables, or modules of other languages directly, which makes existing code or libraries to be reused easily. Developers can write code using the favorite language and then use them in other applications written with different languages. CLE is simple, which is a single core share library with libraries corresponding to each script language.</p>

<p>We recommend that developers write primary logic in a scripting language, and GUI or device-specific parts in the platform-dependent language. Not only ensure application portability, but also take advantage of the platform SDK. Using scripting language may result in a little large about the size of installation packages and a slightly decrease in performance, but these should not be a problem as hardware performance improves and storage increases</p>

<h3 id="its-major-features-are-listed-below">It’s major features are listed below:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Supporting multiple platforms. CLE supports windows xp, windows 7, windows 8, linux x86, android, ios, windows 10.</li>
  <li>Supporting multiple script languages. CLE supports c/c++, lua, python, java, c#,ruby.</li>
  <li>Integrated two-way bridge between scripts. Any language of the c/c++, lua, python, java, c# can access most classes, functions, methods, or modules of another language directly.</li>
  <li>Rich network functions. CLE encapsulates lots of network functions such as tcp/udp, telnet server, http server, soap server.</li>
  <li>Simplify web service development.CLE automatically generate wsdl, support developing webservices with c / c + +, lua, python,java,ruby,c#.</li>
  <li>Distributed function. CLE distributes object’s definition to client side and provides remote call interfaces to help to call object’s functions from client side easily</li>
  <li>Providing multiple tools, including service loading, packaging, publishing,debugging, management, and configuration for win32 and linux version.</li>
  <li>Supporting telnet client, direct use of lua/python/ruby script to interact with CLE.</li>
  <li>Providing unified interface to multiple script language.</li>
  <li>Support delphi.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="version-252-is-released20171204">Version 2.5.2 is released(2017/12/04)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Add RunInMainThread function for ClassOfSRPControlInterface</li>
  <li>Add RegDispatchRequest/UnRegDispatchRequest function for ClassOfSRPControlInterface, and _RegDispatchRequest_P for script.</li>
  <li>Print trace back info for python after exception</li>
  <li>Support insert script objects to parapkg</li>
  <li>Fix bug of python interface, occurred when compile string or call function “eval”.</li>
  <li>Add telnet string preprocessing before execution.</li>
  <li>Force ruby code runs in main thread.</li>
  <li>Script function “eval” and “execute” supports “%@variablename” embedded in input string.When executed, global variable named “variablename” is generated, which value is from input parameter. For example, eval(“print(%@a)”,”hello”) =&gt; 1. set a to “hello”. 2. call print(a)</li>
  <li>lua is updated to 5.3.4</li>
  <li>Add function “GetNameEx” for SRPInterface returns more info about script object.</li>
  <li>Add function “TSRPVariant”,”TSRPParaPkg”,”TSRPBinBuf”,”TSRPSXml”,”TSRPComm” for delphi to help to interoperate with script object.</li>
  <li>For c++ builder, app can use Variant to encapsulate cle object to help call script object’s function or access script object’s properties.</li>
</ul>
